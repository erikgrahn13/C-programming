a)
    struct {
        double real;
        double imaginary;
    }c1, c2, c3;

b)
    struct {
        double real;
        double imaginary;
    }c1 = {.real = 0.0, .imaginary = 1.0}, c2 = {.real = 1.0, .imaginary = 0.0}, c3;

c)
    Only one statement is nesseccary since they are of the same type
    c1 = c2;

d)
    c3.real = c1.real + c2.real;
    c3.imaginary = c1.imaginary + c2.imaginary;
