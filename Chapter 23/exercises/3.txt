#pragma clang fp contract
The pragma can take three values: on, fast and off.
The on option is identical to using #pragma STDC FP_CONTRACT(ON) 
and it allows fusion as specified the language standard. The fast option 
allows fusion in cases when the language standard does not make this
possible (e.g. across statements in C).
The pragma can also be used with off which turns FP contraction off for a
section of the code. This can be useful when fast contraction is otherwise 
enabled for the translation unit with the -ffp-contract=fast flag.
