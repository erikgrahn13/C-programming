unsigned short create_short(unsigned char high_byte, unsigned char low_byte)
{

    return high_byte << 8 + low_byte;
}

The bitwise operator have lower precedence than the arithmetic operators. Which will case the behaviour high_byte << (8 + low_byte)
To fix it we should use parantheses around (high_byte << 8) + low_byte
