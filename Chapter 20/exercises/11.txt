The precedence of the bitwise AND operator is lower than the precedence of the relational equality operator.
To fix it we need to use paranteses around the statement.

#define SHIFT_BIT 1
#define CTRL_BIT 2
#define ALT_BIT 4

if((key_code & (SHIFT_BIT | CTRL_BIT | ALT_BIT)) == 0)
{
    printf("No modifier keys pressed\n");
}
