if the new_node has a higher number than any already in the list
- if the new_node is going to be placed first in the list 
  the coding is trying to use prev as a null pointer

fix
struct node *insert_into_ordered_list(struct node *list, struct node *new_node)
{
    struct *cur = list, *prev = NULL;
    while(cur != NULL && cur->value <= new_node->value)
    {
        prev = cur;
        cur = cur->next;
    }
    

    prev->next = new_node;
    new_node->next = cur;
    return list;

}
